"Adjusted expenses per inpatient day include expenses incurred for both inpatient and outpatient care; inpatient days are adjusted higher to reflect an estimate of the volume of outpatient services. It is important to note that these figures are only an estimate of expenses incurred by the hospital to provide a day of inpatient care and are not a substitute for either actual charges or reimbursement for care provided."
